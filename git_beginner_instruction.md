# Start
Once Git and VSC are installed, create a folder on your PC or remote location where your project will reside and where your repository will be.

**Note:** Repository is not exactly the same thing as a folder with project files. Repository is a place where Git performs tracking of all changes in the project and controls them. While it is in the same place as the project folder, it is not created automatically when you create the folder. You need to initiate it using a command.

 - git init - a command that creates a Git repository

Once repository is created, you can start creating files in it and work on them.
